[center][size=150][b]The Privileges of an LSEMS Supervisor[/b][/size][/center]
[center][color=transparent]SPACER[/color][/center]
[center][b]As a Supervisor, you get access to many things you will find useful on your day-to-day shifts, along with some things you will need to utilize from time to time.[/b][/center]
[center][color=transparent]SPACER[/color][/center]
[b][size=115]The list of things is as follows: [/size][/b]
[center][color=transparent]SPACER[/color][/center]
[b]--> [/b]Access to new vehicles - The trusty Scout, with a customized livery depending on your rank 


[b]--> [/b]Additionally, you have full access to any non-emergency vehicles in the fleet. These still are not toys, and should only be used when necessary, such as an event.
[center][color=transparent]SPACER[/color][/center]
[b]--> [/b] Betsy is now an even greater friend of yours! She will be happy to tow any and all LSEMS vehicles no matter where they are, you only need to ask her nicely! 
[b](( You can now delete vehicles that are TIED TO A UNIT. If a vehicle has been detached from its unit, you cannot remotely get rid of it. The command is "/clearunit unitname" (input the corresponding unit name in the place of 'unitname', for example: "/clearunit C-6" ). This will also delete the Unit, so it will need to be re-created, and its non-leader members need to rejoin. )) [/b]
[center][color=transparent]SPACER[/color][/center]
[b]--> [/b] You are now allowed to sign Medical Licenses for people. You hand these out to people who have completed their EMT Certification or have completed a BLS Course. [b](( /givemedical ID  |  /removemedical ID | Note: It is very short range! Ensure the person received it by having them check their licences.  )) [/b]
[center][color=transparent]SPACER[/color][/center]
[b]--> [/b] You can now ask Betsy to issue new badges to people (be nice to her though)!! [b](( You now have access to adjusting ranks and groups within F4. Be careful when using this, make sure you've selected the correct person. More details in the guide below. )) [/b]

[center][size=130][b](( The F4 Menu for Dummies ♥ ))[/b][/size][/center]


[spoil]
You are about to learn how to use the F4 Menu. Please do not take this tool lightly, you can literally rank down a Lieutenant to EMT-B on accident, and you cannot reverse it yourself. 
Further, [b] DO NOT ABUSE THE F4 MENU[/b], there is no reason to toy with it. Using F4 for the first time is most certainly a scary experience, but this guide is supposed to help you through it.
[list]
[*] Press F4 and navigate to the LSEMS faction. Make sure to click on "View Details"
[img]https://i.imgur.com/kjOyKny.png[/img]
[*] Focus on the left side where you will find the faction menu
[img]https://i.imgur.com/qtkLCeY.png[/img]
[b]NOTE:[/b] The two things you will be working with are:
[list=1]
[*]Managing current members
[img]https://i.imgur.com/P1uQOSA.png[/img]
By clicking on "Members" as highlighted in the image above, you will get access to the currents members of LSEMS, alongside with 3 buttons: [b]Branch[/b] (which is the divisional badge), [b]Group [/b](which is the field of operations rank) and [b]Kick [/b](which kicks from the faction).
[list]
[*]Overview of members section

[*]Overview of "Branch" button
[img]https://i.imgur.com/aOSllnX.png[/img]
[*]Overview of "Group" button
[img]https://i.imgur.com/KgtHIvG.png[/img]
Just clicking a certain rank will update the person. Be careful as there are no confirmations, once you click it, it's done.
[/list]
[*]Inviting new members
[img]https://i.imgur.com/lwh8QTq.png[/img]
Inviting new members into the faction should and can only be done when handling a Contract for a new Employee. Simply type out their name or ID (double-check you have the correct one), and submit it. Then, let them know in a PM that you've sent them an F4 Faction Invite.

[center][size=150][b]The Responsiblities of an LSEMS Supervisor[/b][/size][/center]
[center][color=transparent]SPACER[/color][/center]
[center][b]As a Supervisor, your responsibilities are many. In this section, we will be predominantly covering responsibilities in the field with 'desk' responsibilities sprinkled in. These are not listed in any order. [/b][/center]


[hr][/hr]


[list]
[*]As a Supervisor, it is expected of you to diversify and maintain your divisional skill set. At this point in time, all Junior Paramedic+ are required to:
[list][*]Have a Certification in at least two out of the three: Medevac, Kamacho or Firefighter
[*]Hold an Instructor position in any division [i](excluding the IA Division)[/i] - Instructor = Can train trainees within the division
[*]Membership with completed training [i](completed basic training for the division)[/i] in [b]any three [/b]LSEMS divisions [i](it can be a mix of all offices)[/i]:
[list][*] [b]Office of Operations:[/b] Field Training Division, Air & Rescue Division, Fire & Rescue Division, Lifeguard Division (Note: Medevac & Kamacho combined don't count as two, but either of them count as one)
[*][b]Office of Special Operations: [/b] CRU Division, AMU Division, Forensics Division 
[*][b]Office of Administration:[/b] Recruitment and Employment Division, Public Relations Division, Basic Life Support Division
[/list]
[/list]


[hr][/hr]
[*]Make sure you are aware of your available units at all times (10-21) and make sure you spread the units out to have coverage in areas with high call loads. You do not always need a unit up north, but if you have 5 total units, it is a great idea to send someone who is Medevac or Mountain rescue trained up there.
[hr][/hr]
[*]Make sure any and all radio calls are clear and as compact as possible. If someone is slurring their speech [i][b]purposefully [/b][/i]or making unnecessarily long radio calls, call them out on it, as nicely as possible, and off of frequency if and when possible. (If they are a repeat offender, this should be brought up to other supervisor+ in meetings and in person if necessary).
[hr][/hr]
[*]Manage department radio efficiently. You need to know who's 10-8 at the moment of the Dep. Radio requests and send them to the requested call or location. You can send multiple units if you have at least one remaining after sending the others. (don't leave yourself with 0 10-8 units essentially). [b][u]Be polite on department radio, even if the other party is not; save your bodycam and IA if necessary.[/u][/b]
[hr][/hr]
[*]Avoid explaining things and answering questions in detail via radio, but rather opt to meet with the EMT (go to them, you will make them feel better). This will significantly reduce radio clutter and will keep the channel nice and clean for more urgent communication. 
[hr][/hr]
[*]Make sure that the call list is handled as efficiently as possible. This directly goes hand in hand with unit management.
[hr][/hr]
[*]Make sure to clean up duplicate calls as quickly as possible to avoid stacking units at calls (encourage 10-70s though). CHECK BEFORE YOU CLOSE!!!
[hr][/hr]
[*]Perform random bodycam checks, but do not do it too often to the same people. (( RP Looking at their bodycams and looking for a light indicating their bodycams being on ))
[hr][/hr]
[*]Attend calls as a 10-70 if you are 10-8, AT ALL TIMES. Try having as little downtime as possible. Supervisor presence raises morale (Yes, you literally standing there like a log is better than you not being there, but please do scene management and talk to people, and assist with the call to the best of your ability). For regular 911 calls, you do not need to make a 10-70 radio call (especially if multiple units are responding), however, calls from other departments do require the 10-70 radio call.
[hr][/hr]
[*]Encourage activity! Talk to EMTs, ask them how they are, and make their shift entertaining! Code 1's are a decent way of doing this, everyone gets to practice driving, scene management, patient treatment, radio calls, and most importantly everyone gets to socialize on the call. (([u]Make the game more fun essentially. Nobody likes doing nothing[/u].))
[hr][/hr]
[*]Whenever you attend a call as a 10-70 or during a Code 1 (drill or actual), make sure to look at what your EMTs and EMRs are up to. Catching mistakes early is crucial for improvement and efficiency. ([b]If you do catch someone messing up, correct them for it quietly or entirely in private.[/b])

[hr][/hr]
[*]While you are not out and about in the field, try making an attempt at inspecting EMT paperwork in the divisions you are in. EMTs uncommonly need guidance with paperwork detailing or general direction, if you spot paperwork that could be improved on, try catching the EMT on duty and talk to them about it. If the corrections/mistakes are more significant, you can also contact the divisional command of the corresponding division.
[hr][/hr]
[*] General EMT activity is important for promotions. If they exclusively do field work and no divisional work, this is [i]no bueno[/i], divisional work is very important for promotions, the more the merrier. ( keep in mind, [i]good[/i] divisional work is important )
[hr][/hr]
[*] (( [b]OOC Behaviour also impacts promotions[/b]. If someone is being toxic or passive-aggressive, this does not promote a healthy environment. However, do not assume stuff. Approach them via personal messages, ask them how they're doing and slowly try to uncover why they are being toxic and if there is a reason behind it. )) 
[hr][/hr]
[*] Ideally, conduct any Supervisory paperwork during downtimes, such as but not limited to LOAs, Reinstatement Requests, Contracts, and Certifications. You are of course permitted to do any paperwork off duty, but you are expected to do paperwork, therefore are paid to do it and are not salary farming by doing paperwork on duty. Of course, if a situation pops up where a medic is needed, you should be pausing paperwork for that.
[hr][/hr]
[*]A recently new addition to Supervisory Responsibilities is 1 on 1 meetings, commonly stylized as "1:1" and "1on1" meetings.


In brief, these meetings serve as a touch-base meeting that takes place every three months between an EMT and Supervisors and provide insight into the thoughts and activities of EMTs.

[center][lsemssubtitle][size=120][b]Promotion Process[/b][/size][/lsemssubtitle][/center]
[hr][/hr]
[center][color=transparent]SPACER[/color][/center]
[center][b][size=105]Every single EMT Promotion is a story of its own. Two identical employees do not exist, and as such, every single promotion must be looked at individually. Employees must first qualify for a promotion as per the Promotion Guidelines of Section 3 of the Supervisor Handbook, after that, it is a matter of fine details.[/size][/b][/center]
[center][color=transparent]SPACER[/color][/center]


[center][size=105]Once an employee meets the requirements for a promotion, paired with the fine details such as Duty Reports and their general mood (if someone is passive-aggressive and/or toxic, they are not to be promoted but reformed) (( both IC and OOC )), the process for 'pushing' someone for a promotion is rather straightforward. [/size]
[hr][/hr]
[size=135][b]See below:[/b][/size][/center]
[center][color=transparent]SPACER[/color][/center]
[b]-> STEP ONE ->[/b] Every Thursday (give or take), Command+ will send out the upcoming Supervisor+ Meeting Agenda. All of these are posted and available for viewing [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=1932]right here.[/url] You, as a Supervisor+, should be opening up the agenda and filling it out with your input timely. 
The agenda contains four main sections: General Agenda, Employee Feedback, High Command Agenda, Notes.
The header of the agenda also contains the date & time of the meeting, along with the attendees. 


[b]-> STEP TWO ->[/b] After accessing the Agenda and getting comfortable with it, you need to drop in your input. This can and will vary from very little to a lot. You should primarily focus on writing out information about EMTs you are in contact with during your shifts and employees who you see doing good divisional work. If you have a topic you would like to bring up for discussion, you add it to the first section, General Agenda, with your name, topic, and description of it. 
[b]Example of an agenda topic[/b] (imaginary situation): 
[spoil]Mpache - Pillbox Parking Issues - We've recently had to request PD's assistance with towing multiple vehicles from the lower Pillbox parking lot, but PD has been half-ignoring these requests. Is there anything that we can do differently to improve their response rate to us?[/spoil]
[b]Example of employee feedback[/b] (imaginary EMT | NAME - RANK  - [ CALLSIGN ] - LAST PROMO): 
[spoil]John Bofus - EMT-I - [ ECHO-69 ] - 29/NOV/2021 
      -> Mpache: EMT Bofus has been showing significant improvement since his last promotion. He has joined Field Training and is now actively training EMRs. Additionally, I have talked to him and he is planning on applying to another division as well as getting a certification in either Lifeguard or Forensics. [/spoil]


[b]-> STEP THREE ->[/b] After you've added your input for the EMT, you will need to advocate for it once the Sunday meeting comes up, basically extending your words and talking a bit more about the EMT in general. After this, other employees present their feedback on the EMT as well, and then a vote is made. The vote is decided by the majority, and High Command can Veto any promotions for Internal reasons if need be. Additionally, High Command can promote EMTs without a previous 'campaign' for promotion, if High Command notices a greater quality within the EMT. 


[b]-> STEP FOUR ->[/b] If the promotion goes through successfully, the EMT needs to be promoted in the field. Additionally, EMTs pending promotion are listed just below the Employee Feedback section. For a guide on promoting an employee, go to Section 5 of the Supervisor Handbook.

[center][lsemssubtitle][size=120][b]Promotion Guidelines[/b][/size][/lsemssubtitle][/center]
[hr][/hr]
[center][color=transparent]SPACER[/color][/center]
[center][b]General promotion guidelines for all ranks currently present within LSEMS. Deviations are always a possibility, depending on surrounding circumstances and events. With reinforced guidelines, deviations are going to be very unlikely to happen.[/b][/center]
[center][color=transparent]SPACER[/color][/center]


[b]Applies across the board:[/b][list]
[*]Consistency in meeting the LSEMS 5-hour minimum per week.
[*]Being clean of Internal Affairs (accepted or ongoing) reports and/or disciplinary actions. 
[*]The Time in Rank Before Promotion does not mean that the promotion happens instantly after the time is up - other factors named in the per-rank list matter.
[*]An LOA essentially pauses the promotion progress unless you are active during it (making hours, and/or doing substantial divisional). 
[*](( Long LOAs that are requested due to long-term OOC free time instability due to work, education, illness, or other similar reasons are a slightly different story, in the sense that it is not held against you as it is a video game at the end of the day, but do expect a slowdown due to promotions requiring more consistency the higher up you go. This doesn't mean you are held back, you are never held back, but rather slowed down in progress towards the next rank within the faction. ))
[*]Divisional work is extremely valuable to your promotion progress from one rank to the next. Early EMT ranks are far less subjected to this however - as an example, an EMT-B promotion is achieved through completion of the FTP, an EMT-I promotion is achieved by further polishing your EMT-B self, whereas an EMT-A promotion requires divisional work, without which you are not going to be promoted. 
[/list]


[b]What is defined as 'divisional work'?[/b]
[list][*]First and foremost, divisions are divided into three Offices - Operations, Special Operations, and Administration. This dictates a baseline of what each division's activity consists of, with each unique division building on top of it. Below are descriptions of the [b]basic duties of each division[/b] - these are not fully encompassing of what each division does, but just their very base of divisional operations. You will notice that a lot of the below-listed entries work towards expanding your skill set as a medic, which means that you have the ability to cover a wider variety of tasks and challenges in the field and office.
[color=transparent]spacer[/color]
[*]Divisional Work in the [b]Office of Operations[/b]
[list][*]Field Training Division - a fully certified FTO performing training sessions for EMRs.
[*]Air & Rescue Division - obtaining the division's certifications for a Pilot (Medevac) / a Rescuer (Kamacho).
[*]Fire & Rescue Division - obtaining the division's (full) Firefighter Certification.
[*]Lifeguard Division - obtaining the division's Lifeguard Certification.[/list]
[color=transparent]spacer[/color]
[*]Divisional Work in the [b]Office of Special Operations[/b]
[list][*]CRU Division - obtaining the division's First Responder Certification.
[*]AMU Division - obtaining the division's Doctor Certification.
[*]Forensics Division - obtaining the division's Serologist Certification.

As a Supervisor, you are eligible and expected to conduct Certifications. This is a difficult task at first, but the more you do them (and field training in general), the more comfortable and easy they become. 
[spoil]
[list][*]The Certification process is explained within the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewtopic.php?t=87381#EMRTRAINING]Field Training Division's Handbook[/url], as well as all EMR Student profiles. 
[*]Make sure to follow the instructions carefully, and to handle the Certification as your only focus during the session.
[*]Processing paperwork for a successful certification:
[list=number][*]Let the EMR, now EMT-B, pick their callsign. Tell them they can check which one is available on the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewtopic.php?p=126127#p126127]LSEMS Staff Roster[/url]. 
[*]Give them their medical license. (( /givemedical ))
[*]Tell the EMR about Duty Reports, and mention that they are not mandatory but are encouraged to be filled out at least once a pay period.
[*]Inform the EMR that since they are now an EMT-B they can join divisions.
[*]Ask them if they have a pager. If not, ask them if they want one. Explain what a pager is and make sure they know how to properly use it! (( Make sure they understand they have to RP pressing it with a simple /me, and check the discord if they have the 'On Call Program' role either way. ))
[*] (( F4 rank adjustment, Discord, Teamspeak - reference [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewtopic.php?t=74487]Section 5[/url] for detailed guidance in the case of them being offline on Teamspeak))
[*]Fill out and post the certification paperwork in the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=617]EMR Student Profile[/url].
[*]Archive the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=617]EMR Student Profile[/url], and make sure to rename it to [CERTIFIED] instead of [PENDING CERT].
[*] Update the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewtopic.php?t=9497]General Department Roster[/url] - You only need to adjust the Staff Roster (second post), copy the EMR entry into the appropriate numerical slot in the EMT section, edit the rank from "EMR" to "EMT-B".
[*]Update the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewtopic.php?p=852847#p852847]EMT 1on1 list[/url], adding them to it (ensure they are placed in the correct numerical order).
[*]Post the EMT-B promotion format ([url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewtopic.php?t=104826#PROMOTIONPOST]found here[/url]) into their [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=605]Personnel File[/url] - Post format can be [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewtopic.php?p=445130#PROMOTIONPOST]found here.[/url] (Section 9.14)
[*]Edit the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=605]Personnel File[/url] top post - Title, Rank, Callsign, and the Promotions section, linking to the Promotion Post you just made in their file.
[*]Send them the Promotion Email for EMT-B ( found [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewtopic.php?p=445130#PROMOTIONEMAIL]here [/url] (( Open the link then CTRL+A and CTRL+C the content)) ).
[*]Remove them from the EMR usergroup, and add them to the EMT usergroup, making it their primary group (unless they are employed elsewhere and prefer that one).
[*]Employee Adjustment post - [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewtopic.php?p=445130#RANK-ADJUSTMENT]Format here[/url] (Section 9.12), and [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=573]here[/url] is the location to post it.
Make sure to fill out the format properly;
The title should read  ->  [b]Rank Adjustment | Fname Lname[/b]
[*]Go over to the [b]Ribbons & Awards Section [/b]([url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=1250]here[/url]), and request an EMT Ribbon for the freshly certified EMT. If you are conducting a Reinstatement Certification, they should already have this ribbon, therefore you don't need to put the request in.

[center][size=150][b]Disciplinary Actions[/b][/size][/center]
[center][color=transparent]SPACER[/color][/center]
[center][b]As a Supervisor+, you also have a not-so-joyful set of activities - issuing Disciplinary Actions. Ideally, you want to use your previous experiences and knowledge to defuse conflicts as quickly and efficiently as possible, to avoid having to issue a warning or suspension, but, sometimes there simply is no other option.


Below you will find a list of Disciplinary Actions along with the rank required to issue them.


[u]Please read carefully[/u].


Whichever Disciplinary Action is issued, information about it must be present within the personnel file of the employee. [/b]

[divbox=White]
[color=#FF0000][b]Authorization = Junior Paramedic+ [/b][/color]


A [b]Supervisory Note[/b] is the most basic form of noting something down. These are posted [b][u]without telling the employee[/u][/b], to avoid causing unnecessary emotions. A Supervisory Note should be utilized when something negative out of the ordinary happens. For example, an EMT loses their cool, keeps messing up driving, etc. 


When issuing one, make sure to be as detailed as possible.


The Supervisory Note is different from a [b]Warning [/b]due to its lack of "harm" towards the employee. It is simply a reminder that something noteworthy happened for other Supervisor+ employees to be aware of. 


A Junior Paramedic should consult a Paramedic+ before posting a note for the best result.


[b]*Don't use this for literally every single thing. People make mistakes, you are there to coach them into not repeating them.[/b]
[/divbox]


[lsemssubtitle][b][size=125]7.2 - Warning[/size][/b][/lsemssubtitle]
[divbox=White]
[color=#FF0000][b]Authorization = Junior Paramedic+ [/b][/color]


[b]Warnings [/b]are the first actually serious step when addressing the behavior of an employee. They are mostly a stronger slap on the wrist and usually do not affect an employee's progress too much unless they are a repeat offender. When issuing one, make sure to make it as detailed as possible for future reference. 


Warnings are usually issued as a result of a discussion either within the Supervisor Discussion Board or during a Supervisor+ Meeting, and the employee is always informed of them (versus a Supervisory Note, where an employee isn't informed about it directly).


A [b]Junior Paramedic should not be issuing Warnings on their[/b] own, rather they must [b]consult [/b]a Paramedic+ first.
[/divbox]


[lsemssubtitle][b][size=125]7.3 - Performance Management Meeting[/size][/b][/lsemssubtitle]
[divbox=White]
[color=#FF0000][b]Authorization = Senior Paramedic+[/b] [/color]


A [b]Performance Management Meeting[/b] (referred to as a [b]PMM [/b]effectively always) is a scheduled formal meeting with an employee, relating to poor performance or conduct of an employee. Performance management meetings are not considered negative disciplinary actions by default but rather a fully formal way to educate, inform, and re-train employees, depending on the situation. The PMM is to always be very well documented (what was asked, what was said), and used to evaluate if the employee understands the issue(s) at hand.
It specifically sets out the issue discussed and the agreed actions by the employee, but is open to extended discussion once the core of the meeting is cleared up.


Performance Management Meetings can be a stepping stone (or directly lead) to disciplinary action such as formal warning, suspension, or termination.


A Performance Management Meeting is usually the result of a discussion after presenting a problem regarding an employee on the Supervisor Discussion Board or during a Supervisor+ Meeting.

[lsemssubtitle][b][size=125]7.4 - Driving Evaluation[/size][/b][/lsemssubtitle]
[divbox=White]
[color=#FF0000][b]Authorization = Paramedic+[/b][/color]


A [b]Driving Evaluation[/b] is typically issued once the reported employee has committed a driving-related offense. A Paramedic+ must sit in the ambulance with the employee and evaluate their driving. Once the employee passes their evaluation they are able to drive an ambulance again. Usually, a one to two hour session with the employee, taking at least 4 calls. Depending on the severity,

[divbox=White]
[color=#FF0000][b]Authorization = High Command / Director of Operations / Head of Air & Rescue[/b][/color]


A [b]Flying Evaluation[/b] is typically issued once the reported employee has committed a flying-related offense. The employee must conduct pilot recertification with an instructor before being allowed to fly again. 


The employee's internal Flight License is effectively removed until they do an evaluation.
[/divbox]


[lsemssubtitle][b][size=125]7.6 - Flying License Removal[/size][/b][/lsemssubtitle]
[divbox=White]
[color=#FF0000][b]Authorization = High Command / Director of Operations / Head of Air & Rescue [/b][/color]


Removing a pilot's license is not a decision taken lightly. it is typically done once an employee has done a major flight offense.


The removal can be temporary if a supervisor on duty witnesses a breach of flying protocols bad enough to cause severe damage to vehicles and/or risk to human life, after which, it is to be immediately brought up to the Head of Air & Rescue for further review.  A suspension can be issued when a supervisor on duty witnesses an employee either abusing their privileges or committing a serious infraction that goes against protocol. The license will be considered suspended until the Head of Air & Rescue formally resolves the situation.

[lsemssubtitle][b][size=125]7.7 - Suspension[/size][/b][/lsemssubtitle]
[divbox=White]

A [b]Paramedic [/b]can suspend someone for [b]1 day[/b]. [b]*[/b]
A [b]Senior Paramedic[/b] can suspend someone for [b]2 days[/b].
A [b]Lead Paramedic[/b] can suspend someone for [b]3 days[/b]
[b]Command [/b]members can suspend someone for [b]5 days[/b]
[b]High Command[/b] can suspend someone indefinitely.


A [b]Junior Paramedic[/b] may only issue a suspension while directly (in person) supervised by a [b]Paramedic+[/b] and can issue a suspension in lengths of up to what the supervising [b]Paramedic+[/b] is allowed to.




*[b]A fresh Paramedic should avoid suspending people without a Senior Paramedic+ present, due to lack of experience[/b], but is given the authorization to do so in the case of an employee making a serious enough offense that they shouldn't be allowed on shift. 
This however does not apply to a [b][i]VM03[/i][/b]; if a [b]Paramedic[/b] is verbally or in writing informed of this charge by an employee, they can process the suspension (24 hours from the moment of being informed) on the spot. If the Paramedic cannot process it due to time constraints, they must let the Employee know they need to submit the information to the Leadership Team Inbox or forward them to another Paramedic+.


A [b]Junior Paramedic[/b] supervised by a [b]Paramedic+[/b] may also issue the aforementioned [b]VM03[/b] related suspension.


[hr][/hr]


[b]When a suspension is issued, the supervisor handling the suspension must contact the leadership team alerting them of the details of the suspension via email, and link the suspension post within the Employee's Personnel File.[/b] In case of a VM03, just bring it to the next Supervisory Meeting.
Additionally, when bringing a matter to the Supervisor Discussion Board, it is expected of you to collect information on it beforehand, unless it is urgent and assistance or intervention is required as soon as possible. 


[b][u](( Note: We don't utilize the "Suspended" rank in F4 unless the suspension is 4 days or longer. If you do issue one that is 4 or more days, notify LSEMS High Command as their pay will get scuffed due to how F4 works. ))[/u][/b]


[b]What to do in situations that require a Suspension:[/b]
[list][*]VM03 (Reckless Operation of a Road or Marine Vehicle) - 24-hour suspension from the moment of being informed. If it is a repeat offense in the past three months, to be brought to the next Supervisor+ Meeting.
[*]Other License suspension - the duration of the license suspension + inquire about how the license was suspended. To be brought to the Supervisor Discussion Board upon collecting information.
[*]Misconduct on duty - to be brought to the Supervisor Discussion Board and/or Supervisor+ Meeting; issued after discussing it.
[*]Gross misconduct on duty - when an employee severely steps out of line, suspend them on the spot and bring it to the Supervisor Discussion Board. This can be a severe argument on duty, yelling at a patient/employee, a severe argument with a member of another department, or severe misuse of LSEMS Equipment/Vehicles. Keep in mind that these are on the [b]extreme end[/b], and should be issued by the highest-ranking supervisor on shift.
[*]Breaching other Departmental rules and regulations - to be brought to the Supervisor Discussion Board. Suspend on the spot in more severe or extreme cases.
[*]Breaching Divisional rules and regulations - inform the Divisional Command about it, and bring it to the Supervisor Discussion Board. Suspend on the spot in more severe or extreme cases.
[*]Other - If it cannot be categorized into the above 4, bring it to the Supervisor Discussion Board, or contact an on-shift higher ranking (than you) supervisor.

[lsemssubtitle][b][size=125]7.8 - Termination[/size][/b][/lsemssubtitle]
[divbox=White]
[color=#FF0000][b]Authorization = High Command[/b][/color]


Termination as a form of punishment is very rarely used. Other attempts of reformation must be attempted first, apart from extreme cases.


The Leadership Team is permitted to suggest a Termination to High Command, but it is always a discussion ultimately private to High Command, the results of which are publicized to the Leadership Team.


Terminated individuals are usually placed on a list that bans them from rejoining the LSEMS. LSEMS Command+ has full access to this list and is to intervene when an individual who is banned from the LSEMS attempts to join via regular recruitment or reinstatement.


(( A termination may be based on OOC factors and account-wide at the discretion of the Chief of EMS. 
A player may be faction banned based on IC actions on a character that deem them unfit to be a member of the faction, at the discretion of the Chief of EMS. 
A faction ban may be suggested by the Leadership Team as well. 


LSEMS Command+ has insight into a list of Faction Banned individuals, and is to intervene when a faction banned individual attempts to join the faction by contacting High Command or the Chief directly. ))

[lsemssubtitle][b][size=125]7.9 - Hour Warning(s)[/size][/b][/lsemssubtitle]
[divbox=White]
[color=#FF0000][b]Authorization = Junior Paramedic+, upon approval & assignment during a Supervisor Meeting or within a topic within the Supervisory Discussion Board section. [/b][/color]


An hour warning is issued when an employee does not make their hours, most commonly in instances when there was no communication as to why they could not or are not going to be making the weekly minimum (5) hours. 


Hour warnings exist in two layers, a simple First Hour Warning and Second Hour Warning. When an employee is not reacting to these actions, they are issued a Termination of contract due to AWOL. 


When issuing an hour warning, you email the employee receiving it and post it within their personnel file. Additionally, update the top post, linking the hour warning. 


Hour warnings lower by one every 4 consecutive weeks of hours being made.

Most of the time, an employee of the LSEMS will resign from their duties and leave the department. As a supervisor, you are responsible for processing the resignation and archiving it. The process of processing a resignation is referred to as a Termination, but the term itself can also be used when a contract is ended (terminated) by the leadership team for one reason or another.




[lsemssubtitle]RESIGNATION/TERMINATION CHECKLIST[/lsemssubtitle]
When Processing a resignation/termination, it is important to follow this list of tasks and requirements for the type of discharge. 
[list=number]
[*]First and foremost, give the post a thorough read and see if there are clear signs the employee is resigning for valid reasons.
[*]If you notice ample details and reasoning, go to Step 4 of this checklist.
[*]If you notice that there aren't sufficient details or reasons present on the post, check if the resignation is marked as 'reached out to'. If it isn't, you are to reach out to the employee like so:
[list][*]Mark the topic with the following prefix: "[Reached out to, YOURNAME]"
[*]Following that, reach out to the employee with a regular email, and ask about the resignation (Additionally, BCC LSEMS Command on the email). If they state they have trouble making hours, make them aware of the fact that we are very happy to approve LOAs, as well as the option of going to a Reduction of Hours. If the employee qualifies for EMT-P (Master EMT+), remind them of it as well.
(( Note: Feel free to reach out to them on Discord as well, as a lot of people leave due to OOC time constraints. ))
[*]After 24 hours pass from you reaching out, go ahead and process the resignation. [/list]
[*]If the resignation was posted 24 hours ago or more, you may proceed with the steps below.
[*]Go to the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=605]Employee's Personnel File[/url], update the Discharge Section in the top post of the file, and link it directly to the resignation post they made - then archive the personnel file. If there is no resignation posted, link the Employee Adjustments post. Alternatively, you can also post the Employee Adjustment format as a reply to the Personnel File topic should you wish to include additional information that was not posted on the public Adjustment. If doing so, link this more elaborate post in the discharge section.
[*]Update the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewtopic.php?f=570&t=9497]General Department Roster[/url], removing them from it (utilize CTRL+F and search for both their name and callsign). If they were a division head, remove them from the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewtopic.php?p=647937#p647937]Points of Contact[/url] as well.
[*]Update the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewtopic.php?p=852847#p852847]EMT 1on1 list[/url], removing them from it (click edit then CTRL+F and search for their name).
[*]Revoke access cards, keys, and all other employment-issued access ((Roleplay revoking access and save a screenshot of the roleplay with "/time" - [url=https://i.imgur.com/49dUPy3.png]example here[/url]))
[code]/me logs into the LSEMS database and revokes all department-issued keys and access cards of Fname Lname.[/code]
[*]Remove them from the usergroups they are a member of (( You are strongly encouraged to make a request for usergroup removal in the #forum-and-f4-requests channel, as doing it that way is easier on you and your time! )).
[*](( Create a request within the #forum-and-f4-requests channel for F4 removal. If there is Command+ around at the time of you doing it, ask them to process pay. If you are Command+, process the pay yourself and remove from F4. ))
[*]((Remove TS roles, Remove Discord Roles, and issue them the Guest role if it is an Honorable discharge. In case of a Dishonorable discharge, kick them from the Discord. ))
[*](( Update player-logs in the LSEMS Discord - "[DD/MM/YY] Fname Lname has been removed from the faction. Reason: " and attach the proof of roleplay for revoking their access to the message ))
[*]Archive their training profile in the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=617]EMR Profile[/url] or [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=601]Reinstatement Training Program [/url] sections (If they were an EMR at the time of removal)
[*]Archive their [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=755]Duty Reports topic[/url], training tracking topics, as well as any other session report topics. 
[*][i]Ensure there was no notice of an active IA case involving them within the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=1933]Supervisor Discussion Board[/url].[/i]
[*][i]Ensure they are not currently suspended by looking over recent [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=573]Employee Adjustments[/url].[/i]
[*][i]Ensure they have finished training & have successfully passed the FTP/RTP Certification[/i]
[b][i][color=#FF8040](Note: Failure to meet points 14., 15. and 16. on the checklist is subject to a Dishonorable Discharge)[/COLOR][/i][/b]
[*]Post the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewtopic.php?t=104826#DISCHARGE]Discharge Notice[/url] into the [url=https://gov.eclipse-rp.net/viewforum.php?f=573]Employee Adjustment [/url] section, correctly marking it as Honorable or Dishonorable.
[*]Finally, if you are processing a Resignation, fill out the Resignation Remarks format found below, post it in the resignation topic, and then archive the topic itself.

Hello EMPLOYEE NAME,


You're receiving this email because we have noticed that you did not meet the minimum amount of 5 hours last pay period.


As you were made aware during your interview, on-boarding and contract signing, we require each employee to meet the minimum amount of hours weekly to ensure we're providing the best possible service to the community. 


We understand that there are situations that come up that require you to take time away from work, and we've set up our LOA system for you to use should that happen. Please make sure you're taking the time you need and plan it in advance to prevent future warnings.


Consider this email the [b]first[/b] warning. You will receive one more warning should you fall behind in hours. Should you require a third warning, it would lead directly to a discharge with or without notice.
[hr][/hr]
Kind regards,
